## About the Game

The Bitcoin LARP is designed for 12 to 36 players, divided into 6 groups.

The game has been played at bitcoin conferences and meetups world-wide,
and is a fantastic yet challenging way to really understand what is
happening on the bitcoin network.

There are several phases of the game, each one builds on the previous.

By the end, the group should have walked through:

	- inspecting the contents of a bitcoin-core node
	- validating a bitcoin transaction
	- writing a bitcoin transaction
	- building a peer to peer network
	- exchanging messages over a peer to peer network
	- building block templates
	- mining for new blocks
	- validating bitcoin blocks


The bitcoin LARP was designed by @niftynei, @base58btc's lead instructor and longtime
Lightning protocol engineer.
