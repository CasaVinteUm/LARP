# Wrapping Up - final notes

You've made it to the end of the LARP. All that's left to do
is do a wrap up with the participants and clean up.

Estimated time: 15m

## Table of Contents

  * [Materials Used](#materials-used)
  * [Achieving Our Goals](#achieving-our-goals)
  * [Closing Discussion](#closing-discussion)
  * [Clean Up](#clean-up)

## Materials Used

In this phase of the LARP, we'll use the following items:

	- ballpoint pens
	- node score cards
	- master score card notepad


## Achieving Our Goals

Let's see who did the best job earning bitcoin across the network!

Note: See section in [Setup](docs/01-setup#rewards-for-nodes) about what to use as a Reward.

Instructor Script:

	Ok. Who did the best job of getting their blocks out to the
	rest of the network? Let's find out.

	ACTION: Have each node tell you how long their blockchain
	is. The node(s) with the longest chain should win a Reward.

	Ok. Who did the best job of getting their blocks into
	other node's chains? This is sometimes hard to figure out.
	Let's ask nodes to help us calculate the sum of a node's balance
	in their UTXO set.

	ACTION: Pass out Score Cards to each node, and have them fill them
	out and return them to you. Have them leave their own key color
	*blank*.

	ACTION: Using the Master Score Card, figure out who the winning
	node is!

	ACTION: Announce the winning node, hand out Grand Prize (if you
	have one).


## Closing Discussion

The LARP makes for a great opportunity to lead a discussion about
what participants have learned about bitcoin, things they're still
not sure about, and suggestions for things they would change to make
the protocol better.


Here's some questions to kick off the discussion:

	- What did you learn about Bitcoin that you didn't
	  know before you played?
	- Bitcoin has ten minute block times so that every
	  node has time to both get the latest blocks,
	  validate them, and then broadcast them out to their peers.
	  Do you think 10m is long enough?
	- Did everyone end up with the same blocks in their blockchain?
	- What happens if the network diverges?
	- What's one thing about Bitcoin that we didn't answer today?


We'd love to hear what your participants thought! Feel free to Tweet

## Clean Up

Have nodes bring all of their supplies to a central location, where you
can pack things away.

Here's a short checklist of what to discard and reset for next time.

- empty the blockheaders out of the all the blocks except
  the Genesis Block
- throw away
  - cut string
  - used blockheaders
  - used transaction cards
  - used compact block cards
  - used score cards
  - used Master Score card
- wipe any dry erase marker off any network cards
- wipe any dry erase marker off the transaction validation cards
- wipe any dry erase marker off the block validation cards
- sort network cards into 6 groups, with 5 of each type
- sort key + lock stickers into 6 sets of each color
- pack up:
	- loose binder rings
	- any extra transaction cards
	- ballpoint pens
	- dry erase markers
	- Self-inking Approved stamps
	- plastic baskets
	- miners
	- block + transaction validation cheatsheets
- make new transactions for the next game
	- [Genesis Transactions](docs/01-setup.md#genesis-transaction)
	- [First Network Transactions](docs/01-setup.md#first-network-transaction)
- put Genesis Transactions into the Genesis Blocks, place inside Blockchains


## In Sum

In this portion of the LARP we've:

- Figured out what node mined the most bitcoin
- Held a Post Mortem discussion about the LARP
- Cleaned up
