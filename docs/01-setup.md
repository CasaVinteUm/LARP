# Setup

## Table of Contents

## To Start

To get started you'll need to put together the materials that
go in each original "bitcoin-core" download. Here's the materials
to put together for each node.


## Room Configuration

You'll need 6 tables that are approximately arm's length
(6' ft) apart from each other. Each table should have
enough chairs for 2-6 players.

A cafe table or banquet setup often works quite well.


## Materials for Each Node ('bitcoin-core download')

Each node needs to receive the following materials.

I'd recommend placing all items inside one of the Plastic Baskets.

	- 1 Plastic Basket labeled Mempool
	- 1 Plastic Basket labeled UTXO set
	- 5 Loose leaf binder rings
	- 1 Blockchain (Index Card Case w/ Genesis Block)
	- 10 Block Templates
	- 10 blank Block Header cards
	- 30 blank Transaction cards
	FIXME: sticker page format?
	- 6 Key sticker pages (1 of each color)
	- 6 Lock sticker pages (1 of each color)
	- 1 Self-inking approved stamp
	- 1 Secret Key Card
	- 3 Ballpoint pents
	- 1 Dry erase marker
	- 1 Miner
	- 5 I Have Transactions network cards
	- 5 Send Transactions network cards
	- 5 I Have Blocks network cards
	- 5 Send Blocks network cards
	FIXME: do we have table cheatsheets?
